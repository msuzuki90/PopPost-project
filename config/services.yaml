# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html#use-parameters-for-application-configuration
parameters:
    # -> added this parameter so uploaded pictures can be saved in one folder.
    profiles: '/uploads/profiles/'
    # -> symfony doc: brochures_directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/uploads/brochures'
    profiles_directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/public%profiles%' # re configured directory where i will save files and make the profile variable available in twig template

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

    #App\Entity\User:  
        #autowire: true added this parameter because encountering error where autowire argument $user has been profile picture did not change

    
    # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
    # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
    App\:
        resource: '../src/'
        exclude:
            - '../src/DependencyInjection/'
            # - '../src/Entity/'
            - '../src/Kernel.php'

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
    # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
